* Hangups
** Team: manufacturer
   Do teams ever change manufacturers mid-season? Might have to track a team's manufacturer differently.
   /It's rare enough that we probably shouldn't worry about it. If it happens we could just update the team info for the new manufacturer or include both somehow. I'm sure it's much easier
   to just have one entry per season/

** MXSeason and SXSeason
   Does anything really need to be stored here? If it's just a table with a list of years there's no reason to have this entity. I guess we could store final rankings when a season finishes?
   /We probably don't need to store anything here. Anything I was thinking of can probably be done without it since the year is being stored with the rounds./

** SXRound and MXRound
   Should maybe do something to differentiate between a round that has happened and a round that hasn't happened and is just planned.
** SXVenue and MXVenue
   Do these really need to be separate tables?
   /One table would probably be fine. Maybe just an attribute to indicate whether it is a supercross or motocross venue/
